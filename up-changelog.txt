==============================
Full List of Corrections: 
Last updated on: JULY/05/2014
==============================

Arroyo:
-------
• Hakunin no longer forgets he is mad at you if you continue to insult him hundreds of times.
• If you find Vault 13 but don't enter it, Arroyo won't change, but Hakunin's description and dialogue will! - this has been corrected
• If you complete Hakunin's quest before getting the bonus training from Cameron, you won't get the training. This has been corrected. 
• The Elder should no longer "forget" being mad at you.
• Telling Nagor you won't find smoke would cause him to run into the wilds and die, but the quest would never be set to failed (crossed out)
• Corrected an instance in several of Arroyo's scripts that could cause unending combat. (that is combat until everyone is killed)
• Correct a problem which caused Klint and Cameron to be over-friendly and never attack the player even if the entire map is hostile.
• Looking at Cameron no longer displays "warrior" instead of his actual name, "Cameron."
• The dialog line "Thank you for your help." was incorrectly labeled as a "Bad" response.
• Door to exit Arroyo temple is now correctly unlocked by Cameron just like it would if you had used the key on it.
• Corrected a raised plate in the Temple of Trials that was detected behind the door you blow through with explosives. Before it was detectable despite there being a solid door (no hole in it yet) in front of you.
• Fixed issue of getting multiple pieces of flint from Aunt Morlis.
• Smoke now correctly disappears during the 4th dream sequence.
• It was possible for the inner door to Cameron's chamber to remain locked even after completing the Temple of Trials.
• It was possible for critters in the Temple of Trials to wander outside player reachable areas.
• Corrected a dialogue inconsistency with Hakunin about his garden when you have negative karma.


Klamath:
-------- 
• Telling Sajag about Whiskey Bob's still will now correctly display a gain of 100xp in the message window.
• Slim Picket:
  *You now lose money (50 or 100) if you chose to pay for learning about Geckos/the Great outdoors.
  *Playing as a woman and talking with Slim now displays correct dialogue lines
  *Various other corrections to the dialogue tree within the script.
• Dunton Brothers:
  *Convincing the Duntons that someone is watching them now correctly displays a gain of 250xp in the message window.
  *The Dunton brothers no longer spawn spiked knuckles each time you enter combat.
  *Buck Dunton no longer gets angry at you when you call him Buck.
  *Fixed a bug that would cause the Dunton's script to crash if you save and reload the game.
  *Talking to the Duntons in town about work, turning them down and leaving the map will no longer cause Torr to disappear.
  *Fixed some scripting bugs when talking to the Duntons about work after first refusing to help.
  *The Dunton's shop inventory transfer to their bodies only when on the main town map.
• Whiskey Bob:
  *He now gives you $65 when you convince him to pay you more. (He gave you $55 instead before)   
  *He now, as was intended, snubs you off if you have a negative town reputation.
• Unlocked dialogue options for Maida Buckner during the Torr rescue quest. (prevented by bad scripting before)
• Guard brahmin quest would never get crossed off if you decide to rustle the brahmin instead. (this has been corrected)
• Obtaining the Fuel Cell Regulator now correctly displays a gain of 200xp in the message window.
• Killing Torr or any of the brahmin will set the quest to failed and cause the Duntons to run off. If you told Torr to run away and then   attack the brahmin, you would see a float over the invisible Torr after combat ends. This no longer happens.
• After scaring off the Duntons (thereby failing the rustle quest), you can NO longer tell Torr to run away as well which would allow you to   get the quest to rescue Torr which should only be gotten after a successful rustle quest.  Several script flukes occurred as the result of   this but no longer after applying this patch.
• Fixed a dialogue bug in Maida's script (while talking about the Den) that would cause the script to bypass a check concerning the release   of Sulik. 
• If you use repair skill on the car in Klamath (the one with Fuel Cell) it could display "Error" in the message window.
• Maida Buckner now says Redding is to the south east rather than south west.
• If you had exactly $124 and asked for the bath that costs $125 in Klamath, then the money check would pass and you would get the bath. No   money would be removed from you inventory, however.
• Fixed crash with using the bulletin board during combat.
• Fixed dialogue loop in Ardin’s script which prevented Rescue Torr quest from getting crossed off.
• Torr no longer thanks you for saving his Brahmin with red (angry) text. He now says it in the normal float color text.
• Trappers in Trapper town no longer have all their float text in red. Their floats are now the default float color.
• Killing the newly obtained brahmin by the Duntons, which were obtained upon successfully rustling the brahmin from Torr, no longer   prematurely ends the game as if you had killed the brahmin in Arroyo
• Klamath yellow dog no longer barks (happily) with red text.
• Telling Torr that you are not ready for his quest and then asking him again would cause him to no longer offer the quest. This is no longer  the case.
• If the player agreed to help Torr, then talk to the Dunton brothers and agree to rustle the brahmins, then talk to Toor and make him  runaway and THEN kill all radscorpions before talking with the Duntons again, they leave the map without rewarding the player. This is no longer the case.
• Completing the rustle quest but not accepting the reward no longer leaves the guard brahmin quest as incomplete.
• It was impossible to obtain XP for freeing Sulik through Maida's dialogue. This is no longer the case.
  *Also possible to get XP for freeing Sulik through the quest. 
• When attempting to scare off Torr with Empathy all of his lines are blue- even the ones where you won't help him. This has been corrected.
• A dialogue option regarding geckos was being displayed for Smiley even if he never spoke about it.
• Asking Whiskey Bob to give you a drink (after passing a speech check) would cause the conversation to end prematurely. The reason for this was that the game was attempting to use a dialog line only for dumb characters and thus anyone who had an int >3 could never continue the conversation.
• Bodies no longer age on the Cliff map allowing the bodies there to be looted at any time.
• If you tell Torr you CAN help but then say you can't right now, the quest still appears in your status screen. This is no longer the case.
• If you leave the map and return, the robot turns non-hostile. This is no longer the case.
• If you work through the dialog tree until Slim offers training but decline, from then on he treats you as if your skill is too high to be trained. This locks off any possible training in the event you asked about it, but just didn't have the cash to spend the first time, etc. This is no longer the case.
• It is no longer possible to exploit a bug by which if Mrs. Buckner frees Sulik as a quest reward, you can talk to Sulik *before* talking to Maida and give him $350, gaining 500 EXP.  If you then talk to Maida, she frees Sulik again (since it was a pending reward), gaining you another 500 EXP.  
• Looking at Smiley after having found him now displays a proper description.
• Whiskey Bob's still now becomes non operation after the player betrays him and tells Sajag about it. This was done to fit the dialogue Bob gives you complaining about his still being smashed up by someone.
• It is no longer possible for Maida to keep asking to find Torr once you tell her he is dead. This would sometimes cause the quest to reactivate as well.
• Removed a duplicate dialogue option regarding Smiley's death when speaking with Mrs. Buckner.
• It is no longer possible to ask about Vic once he is in your party.
• Clicking on Sajag when an enemy of the town now correctly causes him to give an angry float and attack you.
• Party member backgrounds were the same no matter if you're in the woods, in town, or in the caves. This is no longer the case.
• When you call the Duntons dumb and ugly they will now correctly attack you.
• Completion of bartering with the Duntons would result in a blank response screen and an option of done which then takes you to the correct end barter response message from the Duntons. This is no longer the case and the irrelevant blank response has been removed.
• You can no longer ask Whiskey Bob about quests you've already completed.
• Sulik no longer keeps talking about Smiley's being missing, despite the player have already rescued him.
• Dialogue no longer ends abruptly when asking Maida Buckner for a drink.
• Goo in toxic caves no longer mutates you if you are wearing any type of power armor (before you would only be protected with just regular power armor)
• If you drive the car to Toxic Cave, you won't be able to access the car trunk. This has been fixed.
• The description of the broken down car with the regulator in the backseat did not change even after picking up the item.
• Offering to buy Whiskey Bob a drink with < $5 would end the dialogue prematurely. This has been corrected.
• Maida no longer keeps asking about Torr after his death.


Den:
----
• Tubby NOW tells you about Redding and mentions something about it - modified dialogue
• Having sex with Joey will no longer cause him to disappear when you leave the map and return back to it.
• You can now get different rewards ($500, $1000, or full $2000 + stuff) from Fred depending on how much you let him initially keep. – before  only got best reward
• Anna's Ghost:
  *Killing Anna's ghost no longer triggers a bug that would remove various dialogue options to ask people about Vic.
  *You now gain the correct amount of xp for burying Anna's bones (600 xp)
• Major dialogue fixes when talking to Rebecca about the death(s) of Fred and Derek.
• The orphans outside each store NO longer continue to accumulate items after the death of the shopkeeper they deliver their stolen items to.

• Removed the tent roof tiles that were scattered on one of the Den slaver run maps.
• You no longer call Cassidy "MacRae" when selling him to Metzger.
• The game no longer says you've helped Lara's gang when you help Tyler's gang.
• You now get the correct message and EXP for helping Lara's gang.
• After you complete the "get 200 back from Fred" quest, the quest "Get book from Derek" would show in pipboy even when you didn't ask Becky for more work.
• Sometimes a message would show up in the message window about trying to access the brotherhood outside door even if you were nowhere near it. This is no longer the case.
• You can no longer enter the unfinished residential area of the Den.
• Corrected issue with the door to Metzger's storage building that would cause them to relock upon leaving the map. (they would be open, but the caption would say there were securely locked)
• Obtaining a bad reaction from Tubby would cause him to alter his prices when you barter. The modifier was set incorrectly, however, so instead of charging more, he would charge less.
• It can no longer take Rebecca years to repair he still.
• Corrected display message when looking at Rebecca's still
• You no longer incorrectly get xp for delivering Smitty's meal late. Also made it so that the variable is set to the correct state (failed) rather than finished. It is now also possible to get a new dialog line from Mom about her complaining that you delivered the meal late. At the same time, a bug was corrected here which caused this line to always be displayed.
• Mom no longer reintroduces herself every time you talk with her.
• Killing Anna the ghost now sets her quest to failure.
• After saving Vic, if you talk to him with having a full party, he says that he'll wait for you at Mom's but he would never leave the room. This has been corrected.
• Unlocked dialog float when Vic enters his house in Klamath (this was unobtainable before due to 1 missing line of code.)
• After attempting to steal from you, the orphans' animations would appear to become stuck. This would cause them to appear to not have death animations if you killed them when they are in this state. This has been corrected.
• Karl in the Den had an INT 10 check that shouldn't have been one - was a typo on the devs part.
• Rebecca will now correctly attack you if you are a childkiller.
• Dumb characters will now give an appropriate float when banishing Anna from her house.
• Becky's Still:
  *Using a tool to destroy the still no longer displays a nonsensical "That does nothing" message right after saying the still was destroyed.
  *When one approaches Becky's still after getting Frankie's quest the message that she has a still appears even though the player already knows this. This has been corrected.
• Frankie
  *There is now a pipboy quest entry regarding Frankie's request to find out how Becky sells her drinks so cheaply.
  *Tweaked/fixed how his script handles the destroy still quest.
• One Tooth Billy:
  *Fixed a bug that would cause his script to crash
  *Fixed issue preventing him from correctly going home to bed at night and returning in the morning.

• Lara's gang no longer remains on the player's team once the player helps them win the fight against Tyler's gang.
• Rebecca is no longer set as an evil critter. The reason for this change is that killing her counts as killing a good critter and all dialogue with her points to her being a fairly good person (she really hates slavery, so makes sense...)
• It is no longer possible to use the "barter exploit" to keep Vic's radio.
• The door in the north-eastern wall in Flick's room can now be locked/lockpicked like all the other doors.
• Fixed dialogue bug with Metzger regarding Vic fixing the radio.
• Hopefully fixed townspeople in the Den from becoming unresponsive when they travel between locations.
• If you talk to Vic for the first time while stupid, you'll go to the wrong dialogue node. This is no longer the case.
• Fixed issue where choosing the combat dialogue option when talking with Tyler about entering the church would not close the dialogue screen correctly and would render it unclosable.
• When you sleep with Sheyla, she initiates dialogue shortly afterwards. If you talk with her again before that and choose to sleep with her a second time, the game then locks up. This is no longer the case.
• Attempting to talk to Metzger (clicking on him) in combat and then killing him causes his script to break.
• Joey now walks back to his gang after having sex with the player.
• Having sex with Karl would not update your sex status. This has been corrected.


Redding:
--------

• Bar brawl quest:
  *You can now end the bar brawl peacefully. - You MUST speak with BOTH of the miners to end it peacefully.
  *A message is now correctly displayed in the message window telling you that you "broke up the bar brawl." - did not do so before.

• Giving the chip to McGrew no longer puts it in his inventory like as is done with LeBarge.

• Medic Andrew (courtyard):
  *Fixed numerous dialogue errors involving the combat armor implants.
  *Phoenix implants now take only two days as that is how long he says they take.
• You now get the XP for having both the account book AND the bishop holodisk - before only got the disk xp if you had both in your inven.

• Barkus no longer initially says he will pay you $250 for Davin (was a typo and should read $200)

• The guards in the courtyard of Vault City now acknowledge your status as Captain of the Guard (before they just called you a citizen).
• Fixed a bug in Happy Harry's stock, where he still has a bunch of expensive items in his inventory after you end dialogue.

• Corrected an instance where Lynette's voiced dialogue did not match her subtitles.
• Corrected an instance when talking with the gate guards as a dumb character two dialogue options with the same text would but would lead to different outcomes. This has been corrected and the correct dialogue option is now displayed.

• Party members now use the Adobe background like is used with Lynette.
• Stark will no longer give text floats to the player despite not being able to see the player.
• Repairing the powerplant and telling Lynette you did this will now grant you citizenship. Due to a bug, this wasn't possible before.
• If you insert the hydro-mag part into the powerplant's maintenance terminal AND then log-off immediately, on another log-in the part is not there anymore. In that cause, it's impossible to repair the reactor. This is no longer the case.

• Tweaked the triggering for conversations with Vic and his daughter. They shouldn't happen with Vic outside the building.


New Reno:
---------
• Salvatore
  *Salvatore no longer locks up when you click on him after becoming a made man, nor if you decline a mission he gives.
  *Salvatore no longer freaks out if you talk to him after he just gave you a mission. He now says the correct message of "Go see Mason."
• Bishop (Carlson quest)
  *Now get $750 if you ask for $750 rather than luckily getting $1000
  *It is now a bit harder to get the $1000 - before it was easier than the $740
  *Can now get the $500 - before got nothing
  *Changed a speech option that was marked as neutral but was really a bad one.
  *No longer duplicate lines asking about his health
  *When asking about his health, Westin's name no longer comes up
• If you sell your NPCs to Big Jesus they now actually disappear
• The comedian now correctly says the 2nd of the two new routines he has after you beat the Enclave. This one occurs if you got Angela Bishop pregnant. Before he would just explode and never say the line.  Now he correctly displays the line and then blows up to the cheering of the audience. (I guess that is what happens to you when you mock the daughter of the boss's you are in...you get shot in the head! ;0)
• All bugs (dialogue, crashes, etc) with T-Ray should be fixed. (Thanks to Seraph for the work he already did)
• Fixed a glitch in how the car is handled in New Reno after you get it back from T-Ray.
• Fixed a bug where if you would come to the Chop Shop on foot, your car would appear there.
• Old Man McGee and his slot machine (Bishop casino) have been added and are now perfect. His proto was on the map, but his script was not assigned to him.

• You are now be able to find the map to the SAD from Sam Pritchard's map. (prevented before by bad scripting)
• If you have a family quest active when you turn that family hostile, the quest will be crossed out (set to failed) in your quest list. If you manage to talk to your employer without him attacking you may get some unexpected dialogue in this case. This has been corrected.
• After wiping out the raiders and speaking with Bishop he may say that you had Skynet with you even if you don't have the robot. He actually means Sulik since the variables are mixed up.  This has been corrected.
• Discount modifier is no longer incorrectly applied with Renesco which allowed you to get all of his goods for $0
• "When you've completed the secret transaction job Salvatore has given to you, go talk to him with Intelligence 3 or less. When he asks you to join their family, because you're dumb you can't talk to him and the dialogue screen closes. You don't join the family, you gain the   job's xp, plus you can repeat this. Every time you talk to him, it happens as if you have done the job again and you get 1000 xp for free."   This has been corrected.
• If you didn't also perform quest 9 for Bishop you won't get to be a Made Man if you ask for more work after this, but you will if you pick the "pleasure doing business" line. This has been corrected and you must (as was intended) complete every quest from Bishop to become a mademan.
• If you talk to Bishop after delivering the briefcase, without being a Made Man or having an active quest, and he doesn't have any job to  give you, Bishop will accuse you of screwing up the Westin assassination. This has been corrected.
• Minor scripting fixes to Mason and how variables are handled.
• You get the briefcase from Moore in Vault City to give to Mr. Bishop, but if you kill Bishop, steal his files, and complete the eliminate-  the-raiders quest trail, this never gets crossed off your action list for Vault City. (If you go back to Moore, he keeps telling you to  deliver it to Mr. Bishop. This has been corrected.
• NPCs NO longer disappear forever after sleeping with either/both of the bishop women and then returning downstairs. (JOY!)

  *He will no longer attack you if you ask him for upgrades after beating the Enclave.
  *He no longer grossly overcharges you.
  *He no longer upgrades your weapons for free when your barter skill is greater than 90%.
• The New Reno bartenders now charge you LESS (instead of MORE) when you're a prizefighter or have beaten the Enclave.
• Killing Myron or convincing him to leave will now lower the Mordinos' power instead of increasing it.
• The hole in the wall of the Cat's Paw has been filled in so you can no longer run through it.

• The doors to New Reno Arms now have scripts attached to them.
• You no longer have to sleep with Mrs. Bishop to lockpick her safe.
• Drug dealers in New Reno now charge less rather than more when you defeated the Enclave or are a made man, prize fighter, or pornstar. The modifier was backwards.
• Jules will no longer acknowledge your car if you left it on Commercial Row and go to Virgin Street on foot.
• It is now possible to peacefully let Lloyd go. Before both end options led to combat.
• Getting knife training (as a male) from Lil Jesus no longer increments the sex counter. This should only happen if you play a female character and actually sleep with him, but for some reason the same would occur if you were a male. (even though you don't sleep with him)
• Boxing fixes:
  *Boxing names are now set properly for stupid characters.
  *You can no longer get infinite boxing rematches if you box for the first time after defeating the enclave.
  *Boxing name, "Lightning" no longer has an addition space after it in all the float messages.
  *It no longer says you beat the masticator if you fight and defeat his replacement
  *Camera now centers on the announcer when the match first begins (no longer is the opponent outside of view)
  *Stuart Little no longer disappears when you lose against the Masticator, say you want to rest, leave the map, and return.
  *Becoming a prize fighter now correctly displays the message that you have become "Heavyweight champion of New Reno" 
  *Becoming a Prize fighter now correctly raises your damage resistance by 5. This now works thanks to Timeslip's engine tweaks.	
• If you enter New Reno via Commercial Row you will start in the upper left corner while your car is in the lower right. The same thing happens in the east side of The Den. Both instances have been corrected.
• Lil Jesus no longer chastises your Melee skill if it is extremely high (295+)
• Bishop's guards at the bottom of the stairs now recognize you if you are doing quests for Bishop.
• Tweaked Bishop's safe so it no longer says ("you cannot repair") when you change the combination or ("you find no traps") when you do indeed find and disarm traps.
• It is no longer possible to tell Mason you solved the Lloyd situation before ever speaking with Lloyd.
• Fixed message error when damaging Wright's still. There was a duplicate line which could potentially cause a crash. In addition, the line that you destroyed the Wright still was never being displayed.
• When digging up the ghoul on Gologotha, there is some grey text which goes by too quickly to read. This text was actually part of the float he gives before you dig him up and thus was not supposed to be displayed anywhere. This has been fixed.
• Going down Lloyd's hole by means other than dialog would cause your NPCs not to follow you down the hole.
• Angela Bishop fixes:
   *She no longer yells at you for killing her father when you have destroyed the Enclave and are a female.

Then I killed AHS-9 (with super stims) gave plans to the Shi doctor, and then talked to Ken Lee. He congratulated me killing AHS-9 but didn't mention the plans. The quest to get the plans from Navarro for Shi didn't cross out." This is no longer the case.
• "When one helps the rocket supervisor from Hubologists to retrieve both verti plans and fuel he's all happy. I managed however to copy the plans and steal the fuel for the tanker using Badger's help and he still says that he needs help but no option to grant it is available." This is no longer the case and a new line of dialogue was added to be said by him in this case.
• If you drop the Vertibird Plans after getting Handy to copy them from you, you can ask him to do it again. This is no longer the case.

• If you Super Stim the Navarro Commander to death and then tell the guard outside you're there to clean the commander's room or retrieve the FOB the guard speaks to the dead commander to inform him of this. Some code was added to check that the commander is alive and thus act accordingly.

• Fixed some bugs in Gecko Power Plant Desk Guard's dialogue:

• Corrected an instance where the voiced dialogue for the Enclave soldier on the network did not match his subtitles.
• You can no longer ask Lenny for healing before you learn he's a doctor.

• Playing as a dumb character will no longer cause NPCs to give floats in red when they clearly are not angry.
• Party members now use the Hub background like is used with Harold.

• Jo now places Gecko on your map after he tells you the location of it.
• Grisham - It appeared that if you saved every Brahmin, you would never see the message that you saved the brahmin, get the 250xp point for it, or an increase of 2 rep points in the town. This has all been corrected now.

• Laddie would follow you around invisible if you did not fully complete the Find Johnny quest.
• Karl now appears back in Modoc when you tell him to go home.
  *everything was set up in his script to do this but he was never placed on the Modoc map. I added him to the map where the original devs wanted him - Modoc Main street.
• The wedding with Miria or Davin will now really be a "shotgun wedding" Before Grisham would disarm during the wedding despite having had a shotgun in his hands before.
• It is no longer possible to talk with Karl normally (as if nothing happened) once he becomes hostile.
• If you begin to ask Jo about a GECK, but at any point select an option that ends dialog before actually getting the quest, when you subsequently talk to Jo, this branch is missing from dialog options, so there is apparently no way to activate it again. This is no longer the case.

• Corrected a duplicate global bit being used by the guy in the slaughter house which would cause Farrel's garden quest to break.

• Balthas's check for considering you a good character has been modified. Not only does he check your rep in Modoc like he did before, but he also checks to see if your global reputation (karma) is below or equal to -500. If one of these conditions is satisfied, he refuses to disclose information to you.
• Playing as a dumb character now correctly sets the variable for delivering the slag message to Jo in Modoc. This means that Vegeir no longer keeps asking you to deliver the message and it is now possible to get the rifle from him for your services.
• Using a Doctor's Bag on Bess heals her leg and now correctly makes he get up like if you healed with your doctor skill.

• After completing the quest, you can no longer still tell Cornelius that Farrel has the watch in his safe.
• Grisham no longer refers to Davin as his daughter after you marry him as a female player. The dialogue lines were mixed up.
• Bess can no longer be crippled when the player goes down the toilet. She never follows you down anyway, so why should she get hurt.
• If you married Davin/Miria before telling Grisham about the outcome of guarding the brahmin, you would never be able to complete the quest. This has been addressed.
• Grisham no longer appears back in Modoc after being killed at the Ghost farm.

• Recompiled the 12 or so scripts that had wrong animations defined due to an error in the original definition of them.

  *Hopefully this should also fix up issues with encounters of Den caravans fighting other caravans.

• If you kill King Aruthur and his knights you no longer get the second encounter.
• It is no longer possible to get every location from a Random Encounter traveler. Before if you ask the traveler for directions, the traveler will say that he/she only knows of these locations. Leaving dialog and then reentering would produce a new set of locations that the traveler only knew about. This did not make sense. Thus, with this patch the traveler will no have the same set of locations for that specific encounter. If you encounter another traveler, he/she will have a new set of locations like in the past, but it won't change each time you talk in the specific encounter.
