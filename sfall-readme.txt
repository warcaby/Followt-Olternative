sfall, a fallout 2 engine tweak mod by Timeslip and many other contributers
version 3.3, built for fallout 2 v1.02 US

Sourceforge project and source code: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sfall
Additional materials at:             http://timeslip.users.sourceforge.net

This was a quick fallout mod which I originally stuck together to try and fix a few minor annoyances that I had with the games, but which then turned into a slightly bigger mod which fixed some other peoples annoyances and some of the bugs in the original fallout engine too, and has since turned into a bloody huge mod with code contributions from a double figured number of people and with which modders could practically write a whole new game. The features are too numerous to list these days, so you'll have to read through the changelog instead.

This mod only works with a specific version of the fallout 2 exe; the US copy of 1.02. Attempting to use this mod with an incompatible version of fallout will result in an error when you try to run it. If your version of fallout doesn't have kids, then you have the UK version instead of the US version, so you'll need to patch it into the US version before using this mod.

Using a d3d9 graphics mode obviously requires you to have dx9 installed and a dx9 compatible graphics card. sfall requires a recent DX9.0c update. (Specifically, the one that includes d3dx9_43.dll.) If you set the graphics mode to 4 or 5 but don't have DX9.0c installed at all, fallout will crash on startup. If you have a version of DX9.0c installed, but one which is older than the required one, fallout will crash at the main menu. Please note that there have been several years worth of releases all labelled '9.0c', with little way of telling them apart aside from the release date. The versions of DirectX 10 and 11 included with windows vista and 7, as well as the versions of directx installed by games, do not always contain the most up to date DirectX 9 components, so even if you think you have DX9.0c already, run the web installer to check if you crash at the main menu.

The current version of sfall only works on windows xp services pack 3 and above. Versions up to 3.1 are available for windows 2000, and older versions are available for windows 9x.

******************
** Installation **
******************

Extract 'ddraw.dll' and 'ddraw.ini' to fallout's base directory. (i.e. the one that contains fallout2.exe.)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you are using a mod that included sfall already (e.g. killaps unofficial path or RP, etc.) then that mod has probably included a custom modified ddraw.ini. In that case, overwriting it with sfall's vannila ddraw.ini will be likely break your game. Instead, only overwrite ddraw.dll, and keep the mods existing copy of ddraw.ini. (Or, if you know what you're doing, you can merge them together by hand.)

The folder 'translations' contains translations of some of the strings that sfall displays in game. To use a translation, copy this folder to fallout's base directory too, and then in ddraw.ini change the 'TranslationsINI' setting to './translations/<your language>.ini'

********************
** Uninstallation **
********************

Delete ddraw.dll and ddraw.ini from your fallout directory.

***********
** Usage **
***********

This mod is configured via the 'ddraw.ini' file, which can be opened with any text editor. Details of every configerable option are included in that file. Where a comment refers to a DX scancode, the complete list of codes can at the link below:
http://www.gamespp.com/directx/directInputKeyboardScanCodes.html

In a default installation using an unmodified copy of ddraw.ini, the middle mouse button will be set to switch between weapons and the mouse wheel will be set to scroll through any menus that respond to the up/down arrow keys. Holding ctrl and hitting numpad keys 0 to 6 will adjust the game speed. The script extender and any engine fixes are also enabled. Options which change gameplay in some way not originally intended by the developers are disabled.

******************
** Known issues **
******************

It is not possible to completely remove the fallout 2 13 year time limit, because fallout 2 stores the time passed since the start of the game in a 32 bit variable, and on the 8th of March 2255 this variable overflows, causing fallout to crash. (Normally, the game will end on the 25th of July 2254) This mod does give you several options for removing the limit, but each option has its own set of side effects. If you are planning on powergaming, as well as setting the TimeLimit line to -3, I suggest setting the WorldMapTimeMod value to somewhere around 10, which will increase the amount of gameplay time you have between tickcount rollovers by an order of magnitude.
