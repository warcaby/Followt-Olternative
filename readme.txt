------------------
(1.0) INSTALLATION
------------------
The manual contains all the installation instructions necessary to
get you up and running.

The Fallout 2 website will contain the latest patches and fixes.  We
recommend that you check there before installing the game for the
absolute latest updates.
                                 http://www.interplay.com/fallout2


(1.1) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------
Required
     Windows(R) 95/98 CD-ROM
     Pentium(TM) 90 or faster
     16 MB RAM
     30 MB available hard drive space
     Direct X - certified SVGA card
     Direct X - certified sound card
     4X or faster CD-ROM drive
     Windows(R) 95/98/NT 4.0 SP3 Only
     100% Microsoft-compatible mouse

Recommended
     Pentium(TM) 120 or faster
     32 MB RAM
     150 MB hard disk space
     DOES NOT WORK IN DOS

The various installation levels will install larger versions of the
game to your hard drive:

* Small     (2 megs: executable, config and support files)
* Medium    (87 megs: adds music)
* Large     (276 megs: adds creature graphics and animations)
* Humongous (681 megs: installs everything!)

It is recommended that you use the largest possible installation
option for your hard drive.  The more room Fallout 2 has on your hard
drive, the faster the game will play.

In addition, when you run Fallout 2, you will need around 20 megs of
free hard drive space for files that are created when playing and for
save games. Save games take up more space the longer you have
been playing. Each save game slot starts around 80K in size,
and will get larger the more areas you have explored.



-------------------
(2.0) MANUAL ERRATA
-------------------
After the manual went to print, we found the following errors
or made the following changes to Fallout 2 (See 2.7 for a note
about the end game):


(2.1) SKILL PROGRESSION CHART
---------------------------
Each skill can be increased using skill points. Skill points are
acquired after each level advancement. The number of skill points
you acquire per level is determined by your Intelligence. See the
manual for details.

Each skill increment from 1-100 costs 1 skill point.
Each skill increment from 101-125 costs 2 skill point.
Each skill increment from 126-150 costs 3 skill point.
Each skill increment from 151-175 costs 4 skill point.
Each skill increment from 176-200 costs 5 skill point.
Each skill increment above 200 costs 6 skill point.

Note: Max skill is 300, instead of 200.

(2.2) PREFERENCES
---------------------------
COMBAT LOOKS: With this preference on, the combat cursor will perform
the 'examine' look when a critter is targeted. This will give you a
detailed description as well as its current level of health. The
examination will be displayed in the text box in the bottom left
corner of the game screen. This preference defaults to "off." 


(2.3) PERKS
---------------------------
The following changes have been made to the Perks:

Hand To Hand: Jab
Jab was +5 Melee Damage, +5% Critical, Armor Piercing, Costing 6 Action
Points.
Jab is now +3 Melee Damage, +10% Critical, Not Armor Piercing, Costing
3 Action Points.

Demolition Expert:
Traps requirement changed from 90 to 75.

Weapon Handling:
Maximum Strength requirement of 6 was added. A character with a
strength greater than 6 would not benefit from this perk so it is
no longer available to those with a strength above 6.

Hand-to-hand Evade (HtH Evade):
If both item slots are empty, each unused action point gives you a
+2 instead of +1 towards your armor class at the end of your turn,
plus 1/12 of your unarmed skill.
Note: You can still have items or hand-to-hand weapons in your hands,
just not weapons.

This Perk gives you (2 * Free AP's) + (Unarmed Skill / 12) = Bonus to
your armor class. 

Perks increasing skills:
Perks that increase one or more of your skills no longer apply "skill
points" towards the skill(s), instead the increase that skill by a
certain percentage. As skills get higher, the cost more "skill points"
to increase that skill. You skill will increase by a percentage
instead of applying the points towards the skill (which could vary
how much it increased the skill by depending no what skill level you
have it at.)

Gambler: Was +40 SP to Gambling; Now +20% to Gambling.
Harmless: Was +40 SP to Steal; Now +20% to Steal.
Living Anatomy: Was +20 SP to Doctor; Now +10% to Doctor.
Master Thief: Was +20 SP to Lockpick and Steal; Now +15% to Lockpick
 and Steal.
Medic: Was +20 SP to First Aid and Doctor; Now +10% to First Aid and
 Doctor.
Mr. Fixit: Was +20 SP to Repair and Science; Now +10% to Repair and
 Science.
Negotiator: Was +20 SP to Speech and Barter; Now +10% to Speech and
 Barter.
Ranger: Was +20 SP to Outdoorsman; Now +15% to Outdoorsman.
Salesman: Was +40 SP to Barter; Now +20% to Barter.
Speaker: Was +40 SP to Speech; Now +20% to Speech.
Survivalist: Was +40 SP to Outdoorsman; Now +25% to Outdoorsman.
Thief: Was +10 SP to Sneak, Lockpick, Steal and Traps; Now +10% to
 Sneak, Lockpick, Steal and Traps.

Note: SP = Skill Points. The skill increase is not the only bonus
to Living Anatomy & Ranger.

General note on perks: Cautious Nature, Explorer, Ranger, Scout, and
Sharpshooter will still give you a bonus even if your statistic is at
10.


(2.4) TRAPS
---------------------------
You can not use explosives to trap doors, etc. You can destroy most
doors by placing explosives in front of the door, but they can not be
rigged with explosives.


(2.5) REST UNTIL *PARTY* HEALED
-------------------------------
On Page 58 of "The Clock and Calendar" section of the PIPBOY2000,
you also have the option to rest until your entire party is healed.
If a party member is injured, this will be displayed at the very
bottom.


(2.6) The Car
-------------
The car in the game runs on Micro Fusion Cells, which is also a type
of ammunition for energy weapons. To refuel the car, use the action
icon "Use Inventory Item On" on the front end of the car (see Page
38 of the manual for detailed instructions.) This will open your
inventory. Use the Micro Fusion Cells to refuel the car. Two Cells
will completely refuel the car.

If the car runs out of fuel in the world map, it's location will be
marked so you can return to it later if you do not have any more
fuel. If you have Micro Fusion Cells, enter the map and follow the
instructions above.

The car also has a trunk. It works just like normal containers. left
click on the trunk of the car to open.


(2.7) END GAME NOTE
-------------------
When you finish the game (after the end game movie, the end game
slide show and the credits) you will be returned to the game
automatically. This will allow you to continue playing. Be warned
that the game is over, and some areas in the game do not take this
into account. We would rather let those who wish to continue playing
have this ability, rather then forcing the game to end for everyone.

(2.8) REFERENCE TABLES
----------------------
The reference tables on the inside of the cover are not to be taken
seriously.

(2.9) ONLINE MANUAL
-------------------
There is an online manual on the Fallout 2 CD-ROM.  The online manual
is an Adobe Acrobat 3.0 file.  You must have a reader installed to
view the manual.  We have included a Win95 version of the reader.

Installing the Reader - Win95
  To install the Win95 version of the Adobe Acrobat reader, open
the Fallout 2 CD-ROM.  Open the Manual directory.  Open the Adobe
directory.  Double-click on AR32E30.EXE file.

To View the Manual - Win95
  Open the CD.  Open the Manual directory.  Double-click on the
MANUAL.PDF icon.



---------------------
(3.0) TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------
These are tips to help improve the performance of Fallout 2 on your
machine.  Also be sure to read the Interplay Productions Reference
and Troubleshooting Guide pamphlet that came in your Fallout 2 box.


(3.1) DIRECTX 5.0
-----------------
We have also provided DirectX 5.0 on the Fallout 2 CD-ROM for users
who wish to install it.  If you are having driver-related problems,
you might want to try installing DirectX 5.0.

To install DirectX 5.0, go into the DirectX5\directx folder on the
CD-ROM and run DXSETUP.EXE.


(3.2) S3 ViRGE VIDEO CARDS (SLOW GAMEPLAY)
------------------------------------------
Video cards with the S3 ViRGE chipset, such as the Stealth 64 3D 2000,
may perform poorly under Fallout 2.  You should attempt two things:

 * Install the most recent drivers available from your video card
   manufacturer.  Often, updated drivers will fix many of the older
   incompatibilities.  Contact your manufacturer, or check their
   website, for more information about their drivers.

 * Use the default S3 drivers (S3 PCI VIRGE) from the Win95 CD.


(3.3) WINDOWS NT
----------------
Currently, Fallout 2 will not install to a Windows NT 2 platform.

While Fallout 2 does not officially support Windows NT, it will run
as long as you have Service Pack 3.  This is required since the
Win95 version of Fallout 2 requires DirectX 5 or higher.  You can
get Service Pack 3 from Microsoft.


(3.4) DIAMOND STEALTH 3000 & MONSTER 3D CARDS
---------------------------------------------
If your system has both a Diamond Stealth 3000 and a Monster 3D
video card installed, then Fallout 2 will not install if you run
the Win95 setup program.  You can try these tips:

 * Download the latest manufacturer drivers from Diamond.
   This has been tested, and seems to fix the problem.

 * Disable the Monster 3D video card.


(3.5) GENERAL SLOWNESS UNDER Win95/Win98
----------------------------------------
If you are playing the Win95 version, and find the game to
be running slowly, you can try these tips:

 * Adjust your Read Ahead cache for your CD-ROM drive.
   You may experience glitches with movies depending on your
   particular CD-ROM drive.

 * Reinstall the Win95 version, but use a larger installation
   size.  Slow gameplay with a small installation version is
   probably the result of slow CD-ROM access.
